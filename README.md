# flask_6_api_management

# Flask-based RESTful API
Using the [templates](https://github.com/hantswilliams/HHA_504_2023/tree/main/WK6/code/flask) provided, I created flask examples named `app_basic.p` and `app_flasgger.py` inside this [folder](https://github.com/EugeneHsiung/flask_6_api_management/tree/main/examples.py). I combined both templates and created an `app.py` flask template for this assignment. By running this application, type in `python app.py` in the shell terminal. The output would be a json file. For example: replace everything after the .dev with `/home?name=John&lastname=Smith` and the output should result in `{
  "message": "Hello JOHN SMITH!"
}`
